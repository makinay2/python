/*-----------------Why Use Views?*/
/*Data Security: to keep the table private or hide sensitive columns from final users while allowing use of some other columns*/
/*Data Aggregation: views are a great way to make it appear as though data is being pre-aggregated and stored in the database.*/
/*Hiding Complexity: shiel end users from complexity.*/
/*Joining Partitioned Data: By creating a view that queries some tables and combines the results together, and make it look like all data is stored in a single
table.*/

/*----------------Updatable Views*/
/*SQL Server all allow you to modify data through a view, as long as you abide by certain restrictions*/
/*-No aggregate functions are used (max(), min(), avg(), etc.).*/
/*-The view does not employ group by or having clauses.*/
/*-No subqueries exist in the select or from clause, and any subqueries in the where clause do not refer to tables in the from clause.*/
/*-The view does not utilize union, union all, or distinct.*/
/*-The from clause includes at least one table or updatable view.*/
/*-The from clause uses only inner joins if there is more than one table or view.*/
